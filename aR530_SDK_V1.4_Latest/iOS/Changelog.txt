	Put latest firmware into SDK, the latest firmware add one API which can allow user send transparent APDU to reader directly, for example, get UID, send FFCA000000 through NFC_CArd_No_Head_Transmit API, then you will get card UID

See define from below:
/*@Name:        +(void)NFC_CArd_No_Head_Transmit:(nfc_card_t)card sendBuf:(unsigned char *)sendBuf sendLen:(unsigned int)sendLen delegate:(id<FTaR530Delegate>)delegate;
 *@Function:    Transmit APDU to Smart Card with NAD+PCB+LEN
 *@Parameter:   IN: (1).nfc_card_t card: The pointer of smart card handle
 *                  (2).(unsigned char *)sendBuf: Send buffer
 *                  (3).(unsigned int)sendLen: Send buffer length
 *                  (4).(id<FTaR530Delegate>)delegate
 */
